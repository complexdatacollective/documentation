_KeyConcept example_

<KeyConcept title="Roster size constraints">
  We have tested a 60,000 node roster with success, however, rosters of this
  size are not without problems. If your study requires such a roster, please be
  prepared for the loading and search functions to slow down considerably. The
  upper limit of this interface is largely dependent on both the device you use
  and your usability threshold, so a powerful laptop might be required
  particularly for larger datasets. For information on devices, please see our
  article on [choosing a device for your study](../_how-to/choosing-hardware.md)
